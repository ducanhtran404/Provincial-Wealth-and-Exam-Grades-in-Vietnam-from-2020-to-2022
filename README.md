Hey coders,

Hope you're all doing well! 

I recently completed a project analyzing the relationship between income disparities, high-school graduation scores, and Gini index across provinces in Vietnam from 2020 to 2022. By diving deep into data-driven insights, I uncovered patterns and correlations that reveal the complex dynamics of income inequality and education outcomes.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on my approach and findings! Your insights would be incredibly valuable as I strive to refine my skills.

Duc.
